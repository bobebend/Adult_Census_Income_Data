# 3 Dataset Shape
# What is the shape of your dataset (rows, columns)?
    (32560, 15)

    # You are probably looking for a dataset with between 1000 and 500000 rows.
    

# 4 Describe the fields
    How many categorical fields? What do they represent?
        -There are seven fields representing; employment status, education level, gender, familial status, ans ethnicity.

    How many quantitative? What do they represent?
        -There are three columns labeled #39, #77516 and #13. I believe column #39 is age, #77516 is yearly pay, and #13 references education level with 1 as Pre-School and 16 Doctorate. There are also three columns labeled with numbers and it is unclear what information they are referencing.

    Is there missing data or data that seems to be wrong somehow (e.g. age = -99)?
        -NO missing values in the adult_data.csv file.


    Has the data already been summarized, or are the observations raw and unprocessed?
        This is a reasonable clean dataset. Originally used to determine if a person made above or below $50,000.



# 5 Potential avenues of inquiry
    Initial data exploration often sparks additional questions or potential insights that could be supported by continued exploration.

    What types of questions does this dataset seem to support?
        -Potentially a breakdown of income vs ethnicity/gender/education level or possibly education level vs job type

    Be especially on the lookout for avenues of inquiry that produce a tangible value (the ability to make better targeted or informed decisions, or some other potential benefit to stakeholders).

# 6 Value proposition
    Imagine that this dataset was provided by some stakeholder.

    What are the potential benefits to your proposed line of inquiry? It's ok if this adjusts as you become more acquainted with the data.

        -Not clear at this point
